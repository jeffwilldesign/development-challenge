  ENDLESS | Development Challenge
</h1>

An ENDLESS development challenge solution by @jeffwilldesign built in React using Gatsby. Check out the challenge demo site at (https://devchallenge.jeffwilldesign.com) or pull the code and spin up the project locally using the steps below.

## Quick start

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

    ```shell
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies.**

    ```shell
    yarn
    ```
    or
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the project directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

2.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

3.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

4. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

5. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
